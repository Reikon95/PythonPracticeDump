Iterating through lines - prints each line ib a doc

Only reading one line of doc

Writing to a document (w means write in this case, after the file name)
This example opens a document filled with bad bands in writeable mode
Then we just add BrokeNCYDE because they sucked.
'''

with open('bad_bands.txt', 'w') as bad_bands_doc:
  bad_bands_doc.write('BrokeNCYDE')
  
''' 

Appending a document means you aren't totally rewriting it like the above
It adds to it rather than overwrites. Note the a in the place of w

Open CSV files is easy as they are basically just plain text

See below 

'''

with open('logger.csv') as log_csv_file:
  stre = log_csv_file.read()
  print(stre)

'''

That being said, not always best to open as plain text
You can import a CSV module which basically makes it easier to handle.
You can save it as a dictionary which again makes it easier
Line is the key, so we are asking for it to print the value.

And with a delimiter...
